# HyperParameterTunability

The following repository contains 
* the scripts for collecting performance data of 5 
machine learning algorithms on 200 classification tasks from OpenML environment
* the performance data of Random Forest, AdaBoost and Extra Trees Classifiers.

The classification algorithms are the following: 

* Random Forest 
* AdaBoost(with Decision Trees as the base-classifier)
* Support-Vector Machine 
* Gradient Boosing 
* Extra Trees 

You can collect the performance data for any of the above mentioned algorithms by 
running the `Collect.py`, specifing the path to the datasets and the algorithm of interest
on the last line of the script.
